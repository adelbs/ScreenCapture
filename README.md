# ScreenCapture
This is an easy way to capture screen and record videos.
Through this tool you can:
* Press Ctrl + Print (or Ctrl + *) to capture and highlight the screen;
* At the ScreenCapture, press Ctrl + S to save the highlighted area, or Ctrl + C to copy it to the clipboard;
* Its easy to record screen videos (without audio);

Feel free to fork it or sugest anything. This project is at GNU General Public License v3.0.

I intend to write a wiki explaining how to use it.
